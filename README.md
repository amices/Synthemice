# Synthetic data with mice

This repository contains the full publication archive for the publication
[Anonymiced Shareable Data: Using mice to Create and Analyze Multiply Imputed Synthetic Datasets](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/3/4/45) by [Thom Volker](https://thomvolker.github.io) and [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com), and then some. 

- The folder `mice_synthesizing` contains the simulation studies of interest, and includes a `ReadMe` file of its own, to guide the reader through any work produced in this folder. 
- The `synthpop_synthesizing` folders contains a number of files related to simulations concerning synthesizing data with `synthpop`, but these are not of interest in the current project anymore. 
- The folder `gerko` contains some files that are used to assess how to obtain confidence valid variance estimates from bootstrapped data.
