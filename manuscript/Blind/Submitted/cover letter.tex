Dear Editor,\\
\newline

We would like to submit the attached manuscript, ”Anonymiced shareable data: Using mice to create and analyze multiply imputed synthetic data sets” for consideration for possible publication in the special issue on \emph{Computational Aspects, Statistical Algorithms and Software in Psychometrics} in \texttt{Psych}. The manuscript outlines a procedure to generate synthetic data sets with \texttt{mice} in {R}. The proposed workflow yields valid univariate and multivariate estimates and allows for valid inference on synthetic data sets generated with \texttt{mice}. We believe that the procedure in our manuscript solves an important problem for applied research and the readership of \texttt{Psych}.

The paper has not been published or accepted for publication elsewhere. It is not under consideration at another journal or at Sociological Methods and Research.

Sincerely, 
\newline\\
